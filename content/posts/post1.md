Today I passed my final evaluation of the third project I've attempted at 42 Wolfsburg, to celebreate, instead of moving on to the next one, I gave myself a little break by looking into GitHub Pages, where you are reading this now. Some Jekyll installation issues and a few hours later, the basic site is mostly ready, and now I just need to add my touch!

I picture this site as a mainly Software-focused portal, for obvious reasons. I will include related journalling, and explained code where it is interesting, and comment on what is being developed and included in my open GitHub account.

I began this Software journey as an unsuspecting Instagram scroller, where an Ad appeared, saying something along the lines of: "learn coding for free in a groundbreaking school!" Indeed, I was more than interested. As an Aerospace Engineer, I had done coding during my studies, and here and there I had found ways to use it for very applied situations. I can now say I've been learning coding for coding's sake, and it is a different animal. The way of thinking is not so much about the end result, but about the whole implementation, and its implications. I look forward to sharing it.
