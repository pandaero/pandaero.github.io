For the first time since I began the course, I have quit attempting the bonus part of the project assignment. I had spent over 10 hours exclusively on the bonus, and the implications had been considered from the start. This is for the `42 - printf` project.

On the one hand, it's a shame, because of the lost work, and mostly because of the lost enthusiasm that coming up with the bonus had brought about.

Instead, after testing the first aspects of the bonus and seeing they were not 100% properly working, I could anticipate my future frustration getting the next aspects done, and the existing ones **100%**. I made a heart-felt peace with appreciating the exercise, and moving on without including bonus for it.

This gave me time to wait for the evaluations, and to wish for people to want the evaluations I had to give (in the 42 peer-learning model, evaluations are a currency: to submit a project you need to have enough evaluation points to receive the evaluations from a peer. Each project usually requires 3 evaluations).

So I looked into this blog/journal/project website again where I had left off: the horrible dealings with Jekyll. I already knew of a better way, using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), but the GitHub default was Jekyll. A Google search gave me hope that it could be done, but the first method didn't work. Then, a [video](https://youtu.be/Z_7Rluf_Z-Q) by GitHub themselves reassured me that the much cleaner and painless way was possible. This led to this website being on a cutting-edge implementation, as it is very recent work by GitHub that allows it to run.
