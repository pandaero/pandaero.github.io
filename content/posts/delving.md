Today I passed my final evaluation of the third project I've attempted at [42 Wolfsburg](https://42wolfsburg.de), to celebreate, instead of moving on to the next one, I gave myself a little break by looking into GitHub Pages, where you are reading this now. Some [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) installation issues and a few hours later, the basic site is mostly ready, and now I just need to add my touch!

I picture this site as a mainly Software-focused portal, for obvious reasons. I will include related journalling, and explained code where it is interesting, and comment on what is being developed and included in my [GitHub account](https://github.com/pandaero).

I began the formal part of this Software journey as an unsuspecting Instagram scroller, where an Ad appeared, saying something along the lines of: "learn coding for free in a groundbreaking school!" Indeed, I was more than interested. As an Aerospace Engineer, I had done coding during my studies, and here and there I had found ways to use it for very applied situations. However, after enrolling in the school, I can now say I've been learning coding for software's sake instead, and it is a completely different animal. One big realisation is that the way of thinking is not so much about the end result, but about the whole implementation, and its different aspects and implications. I look forward to sharing it.
